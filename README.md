# EDA Instagram Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Instagram Data** to uncover insights into user engagement, post performance, and account growth. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the project processes, visualizes, and interprets key metrics from Instagram data.

## Objectives
- Analyze Instagram engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and follower growth.
- Identify trends and patterns in user behavior.
- Visualize data to gain insights into content performance.
- Provide actionable recommendations for optimizing Instagram strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data Analysis & Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive Development)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Plotly** (Interactive Graphs)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7+). Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly Wordcloud jupyter
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajatgupta3121/Instagram_EDA_project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd EDA_Instagram
   ```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `EDA_Instagram_data_Analysis.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Features & Analysis Conducted
